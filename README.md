# 2710 Hashing Final Project

For our final project for our 2710 Advanced Data Structures and Algorithm Development class, we decided to make a program that had the ability to take any message under 100 characters and encrypt it into a unique set of numbers. This program also has a function where it can take any message created by the algorithm and decrypt it back into the original message.
